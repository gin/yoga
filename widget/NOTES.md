To Do:
- show position's range (might need to get from external API) Ask Charlie about if there's any websites he saw?
- show current price of pair
- show if price is in range or out
- alert user if out of range (future can adjust position automatically)

To generalize later:
- PoolID's link works for 1 chain (mainnet Ethereum), need to switch RPC

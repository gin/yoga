To Do:
- show current price of pair
- show if price is in range or out
- alert user if out of range (future can adjust position automatically)

To generalize later:
- PoolID's link works for 1 chain (mainnet Ethereum), need to switch RPC
- bug: unable to calculate price from ticks for small tokens
  (e.g. dsync, Pool ID: 0x3f4b40bbbb1b6f8cdd48281c56b9ea7c7934715c735dda1c430ab4d156b96630)
